# hello-world
Marcel's first Github project

Hello folks,
I used to code long way back and now I am settling down in life,
I have this urge to get back into coding.
So that's why I am here to see how this GitHub will suit me.
I have tons of questions, like for which platform are we coding here?

I hope to get to know some of you.

Thanks
Marcel in sunny Orlando
